# RouteErrorBoundary Usage Guide

## Why RouteErrorBoundary Wasn't Working

The issue with the RouteErrorBoundary was likely due to:

1. **Hook Usage in Fallback**: The `useNavigate` hook was being called outside of a proper React component context
2. **Static Fallback**: The fallback was created as a static JSX element instead of a proper component

## Fixed Implementation

The RouteErrorBoundary now properly creates the fallback as a React component:

```tsx
const FallbackComponent = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // ... rest of the component
};

return (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<FallbackComponent />}>
    {children}
  </ErrorBoundary>
);
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Page-Level Error Boundary

```tsx
import { RouteErrorBoundary } from '@/components/common/route-error-boundary';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <RouteErrorBoundary>
      <PageContent />
    </RouteErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### 2. Custom Error Messages

```tsx
<RouteErrorBoundary
  fallbackTitle="Profile Error"
  fallbackMessage="There was a problem loading your profile. Please try again."
  showBackButton={true}
>
  <UserProfile />
</RouteErrorBoundary>
```

### 3. Section-Level Error Boundary

```tsx
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RouteErrorBoundary
        fallbackTitle="Chart Error"
        fallbackMessage="Unable to load chart data."
        showBackButton={false}
      >
        <ChartSection />
      </RouteErrorBoundary>
      
      <RouteErrorBoundary
        fallbackTitle="Table Error"  
        fallbackMessage="Unable to load table data."
      >
        <DataTable />
      </RouteErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Form Error Boundary

```tsx
<RouteErrorBoundary
  fallbackTitle="Form Error"
  fallbackMessage="There was a problem with the form. Please refresh and try again."
>
  <ContactForm />
</RouteErrorBoundary>
```

## When to Use RouteErrorBoundary vs ErrorBoundary

### Use RouteErrorBoundary when:
- You want page-level error handling
- You need navigation options (Go Back button)
- You want smaller, contextual error messages
- Wrapping specific page sections or components

### Use ErrorBoundary when:
- You want app-level error handling
- You need full-page error displays
- You want comprehensive error information
- Wrapping the entire application or major sections

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to `/route-error-test` 
2. Click "Trigger Route Error"
3. Verify the RouteErrorBoundary shows:
   - Orange warning icon
   - Custom title and message
   - "Reload Page" button
   - "Go Back" button (if enabled)
4. Test the "Go Back" functionality
5. Test the error reset by clicking "Reset" and triggering again

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide meaningful error messages** for your specific use case
2. **Use showBackButton={false}** for components where navigation doesn't make sense
3. **Combine with app-level ErrorBoundary** for comprehensive error handling
4. **Test error boundaries** in development before deploying
5. **Consider user experience** - provide recovery options that make sense for your context
